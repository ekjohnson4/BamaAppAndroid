### About

The goal of this project is to correct several design flaws found in the current implementation of the current Alabama app. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Home page navigation
* Multiple student/staff logins
* Linking to and relying on third party apps

A general design of our app can be seen in the video above. This new implementation will feature a d=refined design as well as new features.
